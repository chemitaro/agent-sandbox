# Completion checklist

- Update `.spec-dock/current/report.md` with commands/results/changes.
- Run required tests (if added); repo currently uses bash tests (to be added).
- Avoid prohibited git commands (`git add/commit/push/merge`).
- Keep `.env` secrets intact; avoid overwriting unless specified.
